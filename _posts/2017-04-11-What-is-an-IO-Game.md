You've probably already heard of agar.io and slither.io, two incredibly popular, free-to-play browser games. The original, agar.io, took incredibly simple mechanics and paired them an instant, massive multiplayer experience. Taking the concept and running with it, slither.io referenced the Snake games you'd find on old Nokia phones and made a multiplayer version that became a YouTube craze.

These two games marked the beginning of something new and different, and they've since inspired many developers to make easy-to-get-into browser games. Collectively, the genre has become known as the IO Game, named after the '.io' [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) that most of the games use. Two of our favourites are agar.io and generals.io, but there are many more out there, as seen on aggregators like [iogames.space](http://iogames.space). There is such a variety of interpretations of the IO Game that it's easy to wonder what exactly an IO Game is.

Is it enough to say that an IO Game is any simple, multiplayer, browser-based game? It's hard to escape this definition and still resemble the agar.io and slither.io roots of the genre: the easiest way out is to be single player, but there hasn't been much success in single-player content in the browser. Is [Realm of the Mad God](http://www.realmofthemadgod.com/) an IO Game, then? It is hard to picture the old, loading-intensive Flash games that we played more than a decade ago as something we'd be tabbing to in the middle of procrastinating on work in the way that many do with agar.io. No, there's definitely something snack-sized about an IO Game, and leveraging modern Canvas or WebGL browser tech is crucial in avoiding the loading times that Flash, Java, and even many Unity web applications suffer from.

There's another important element to consider about the IO Game that was added when slither.io came about: the multiplayerization and browser reimagining of an existing genre. Snake wasn't a complicated game to begin with, but slither.io still managed to distill from it a more general style of combat that could work for hundreds of players in the same playfield. Not all games ending in .io adopt this quality, but the ones that do are instantly more relatable for a large audience of users. Retroactively, agar.io even seems like a reduced, multiplayer form of [Katamari Damacy](https://www.giantbomb.com/katamari-damacy/3025-402/). The very unique generals.io is a pseudo-real-time strategy game in the midst of all these action games, a very simple form of something like [Starcraft](https://www.giantbomb.com/starcraft/3025-326/) or [Command & Conquer](https://www.giantbomb.com/command-conquer/3025-98/). Finally, starve.io is actively a member of the extremely popular survival genre, and while it's not as minimalist as some of the other games we've discussed here, it does allow you to play a survival game without delving into the realm of Steam (and usually Steam Early Access).

What is an IO Game? Here's our idea.

**An IO Game is a lightweight, multiplayer, in-browser take on an established genre.**

How does nibbly.io fit in? We use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) (whoa!) in combination to avoid load times and keep the game running smoothly (we hope!). We also took inspiration from [Pok√©mon](https://www.giantbomb.com/pokemon/3025-452/) and simplified it down to just battling and collecting creatures. With any luck, we've contributed something fun to this brand-new IO Game genre that we enjoy so much, and we hope you like it too. Hop back to the [nibbly.io home page](http://nibbly.io) to try it out.
